            <b>This is the second item's according body.</b> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds 
            the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall 
            appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with 
            custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth nothing that just about any HTML 
            can go within the <span style="color: #d63384;">.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow.
